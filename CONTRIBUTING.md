Found a Bug?
===============================================================================
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/Ephigenia/mite-cli/issues) to our [GitHub Repository][https://github.com/Ephigenia/mite-cli]. Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/Ephigenia/mite-cli/pulls) with a fix.


Branching
===============================================================================

Not defined yet, probably going for "gitlab flow", see: https://medium.com/@patrickporto/4-branching-workflows-for-git-30d0aaee7bf

New code should always be reviewed in a Merge Request aka Pull-Request.


Code-Style
===============================================================================
The project uses [Eslint](eslint.org) to check the code formatting of the javascript files. It uses a slightly modified version of the `eslint:recommend` standard.

Code style can be checked while editing by using an editor which can read the `.eslintrc` file (f.e. [atom](https://atom.io), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) or by running `npm run lint`.

In addition to that the rules for other file formats are defined in `.editorconfig`.

Linting can be checked with

    npm run lint

And fixed

    npm run lint:fix


Code-Tags
===============================================================================

Itâ€™s quite common to leave inline comments in the sources to mark places of importantness, todos, or questions for review or places of interest.

Read more about them: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0350/#what-are-codetags

There are several most common tags: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `BUG`, `HACK`, `TODOC`, `FAQ`, `GLOSS`.
